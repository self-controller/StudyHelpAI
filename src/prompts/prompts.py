                    1. The main topic of the lecture

                    4. Important takeaways or conclusions
                    
                    For assignments, look for phrases like:
                    - "homework due"
                    - "assignment due"
                    - "project deadline"
                    - "test on"
                    - "quiz next"
                    
                    Format dates as YYYY-MM-DD. If no specific date is given, try to infer from context (e.g., "next week", "Friday").'''
